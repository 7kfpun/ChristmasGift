**Christmas gift exchange for 2017**

Theme: Priceless

It was built for Christmas gift exchange. The lucky one would get an app with his/her name as the name of the application and his/her face as the icon.

And he/she could "talk" to himself/herself in the app...when feeling lonely...

See, how priceless it is! 🍃🍃🍃

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! 🎅🏻🎄🎁🎉
